# Couchbase Lite 

**Couchbase Lite** is an embedded lightweight, document-oriented (NoSQL), syncable database engine.

Latency matters a lot to users, so a local database takes frustration out of the equation. Itâ€™s got JSON documents, and the same map/reduce as Couchbase Server, in a pint-sized edition.

Couchbase Lite compiles natively for iOS, Android, Mac OS and .NET. Half a megabyte optimized, for quick launch and snappy user experience on occasionally connected devices when data matters.

**Lightweight** means:

* Embedded: The database engine is a library linked into the app, not a separate server process.
* Small code size: currently under 600kbytes. This is important to mobile apps, which are often downloaded over cell networks.
* Quick startup time on relatively-slow CPUs: currently under 50ms on recent iPhones.
* Low memory usage with typical mobile data-sets. The expectation is the number of documents will not be huge, although there may be sizable multimedia attachments.
* "Good enough" performance with these CPUs and data-sets. (Exact figures depend on your data and application, of course.)

**Document-oriented** means:

* Like Couchbase Server, it stores records in flexible [JSON](http://json.org) format instead of requiring predefined schemas or normalization.
* Records/documents can have arbitrary-sized binary attachments, like multimedia content.
* Your application's data format can evolve over time without any need for explicit migrations.
* Map/reduce indexing allows fast lookups without needing to use special query languages.
* Documents can contain free-form text or geographic coordinates, which are efficiently indexed for full-text search or geo-querying.

**[Syncable](http://syncable.org/)** means:

* Any two copies of a database can be brought into sync via an efficient, reliable, proven REST-based [protocol][23].
* Sync can be on-demand or continuous (with a latency of a few seconds).
* The sync engine supports intermittent and unreliable network connections.
* Conflicts can be detected and resolved, with app logic in full control of merging.
* Revision trees allow for complex replication topologies, including server-to-server (for multiple data centers) and peer-to-peer, without data loss or false conflicts.

The native APIs are Objective-C (iOS, tvOS, Mac), Java (Android), and C# (.NET, Xamarin); but an optional internal REST API adapter allows it to be called from other languages like JavaScript, for use in apps built with PhoneGap/Cordova or Titanium.

## Building Couchbase Lite ##

If you want the very latest and greatest (and possibly buggy) version, you'll need to build it yourself. For instructions see the [wiki page][7].

## Include via Carthage ##

Can be included in any iOS project via [Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage)
 
Add the following line to your Cartfile:
   
```
github "couchbase/couchbase-lite-ios" "release/1.3.0"
```

(or substitute the branch name corresponding to the specific release you want.) Run `carthage update --platform ios`, and you should now have the latest version of Couchbase Lite iOS in your Carthage folder.
