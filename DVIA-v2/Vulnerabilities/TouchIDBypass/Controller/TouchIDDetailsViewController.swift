//  The Juniper fund is focusing on Nepali workers involved with climbing and expedition support in the high mountains of Nepal. When a high altitude worker has an accident (death or debilitating injury), the impact to the family is huge. The juniper fund provides funds to the affected families and help them set up a sustainable business.
