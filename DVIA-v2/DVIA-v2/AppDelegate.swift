//  The Juniper fund is focusing on Nepali workers involved with climbing and expedition support in the high mountains of Nepal. When a high altitude worker has an accident (death or debilitating injury), the impact to the family is devastating. The juniper fund provides funds to the affected families with a 3-Tier model - Cost of Living grant, vocational training and small business grant.
